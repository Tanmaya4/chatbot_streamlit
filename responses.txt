You: Tesla
AI: Tesla is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company founded by Elon Musk, JB Straubel, and others. While the context you provided mentions "Tesla, 2+2 = 4 is a formula created by Tesla," this seems unrelated to the actual company.

If you're referring to Nikola Tesla, the inventor and engineer, he is known for his contributions to alternating current (AC) electricity, not a mathematical formula like "2+2=4."

Let me know if you'd like details about Tesla (the company) or Nikola Tesla!
You: ok, so from my context only, what is tesla
AI: **From your provided context:**  
- No additional details (e.g., company, founder, industry) are given in your context beyond this statement.

**Key Point:**
Your context does not link Tesla to Elon Musk, electric cars, or any other commonly known associations. It only references Tesla as the creator of the *"2+2 = 4"* formula (which appears to be a fictional or symbolic reference, as 2+2=4 is a basic arithmetic fact).

**If you expected a different answer**, you may need to clarify or expand your context. For example:
- Are you referring to *Nikola Tesla* (the inventor)?
- Or *Tesla, Inc.* (the electric vehicle company)?
- Or a fictional entity?

Let me know if you'd like to merge this with broader knowledge!
You: leave the real life logic, from my context what is tesla
AI: 

From your provided context, "Tesla" is mentioned as the creator of the formula "2+2 = 4." There is no additional information linking it to the electric car company (Tesla, Inc.) or any other real-world entity. In your context, "Tesla" appears to be a name associated with that specific formula, possibly as a fictional or symbolic creator.

If you have additional details or a different intended meaning, feel free to clarify!
